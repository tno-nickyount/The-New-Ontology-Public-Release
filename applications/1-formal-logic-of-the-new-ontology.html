  <h1>Formal Logic and the New Ontology: Toward a Structural System</h1>
  <em>A dual-sorted logic model for capturing force, meaning, and resolution in the Master Domain.</em>

  <hr>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>The New Ontology asserts that reality is a dual-domain structure in which all intelligible phenomena instantiate through force in the Empirical Domain and through coherence in the Aetherial Domain.</p>

  <p>To formalize this structure, we outline a <strong>minimum viable product (MVP)</strong> for a formal logic system capable of representing and evaluating structural presence, identity, and collapse.</p>

  <p>This supplement introduces the syntax, semantics, rules, and operations necessary to begin modeling the New Ontology computationally and conceptually.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>Dual-Sorted Syntax</h2>
  <p>Our formal system operates with two distinct syntactic layers:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Empirical Terms</strong> represent <em>Objects</em>—physical entities, governed by force. These terms include variables, predicates, and operations corresponding to mass, motion, and spatial configuration.</li>
    <li><strong>Aetherial Terms</strong> represent <em>Forms</em>—semantic structures, governed by coherence. These terms model meaning, alignment, contradiction, and structural fidelity.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Each syntactic layer is governed by its own rules, akin to multi-sorted logic or typed formal systems. Together, they allow us to model both presence <em>and</em> intelligibility, across both domains.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>Interpretation Functions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Empirical Interpretation</strong> maps empirical terms to structures governed by physical law—measurable, causal, and extended.</li>
    <li><strong>Aetherial Interpretation</strong> maps Forms to a logic of structural consistency—noncontradiction, alignment, and recursive resolution.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>These interpretations ensure domain fidelity: that empirical terms preserve measurement-based relations, and that Aetherial terms do not instantiate if they result in contradiction.</p>

  <p>A mapping function enables translation between domains—e.g., identifying the Form a physical Object corresponds to, or evaluating whether an action coheres with a resolved moral structure.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>Inference and Proof</h2>
  <h3>Empirical Inference</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Operates on classical rules (e.g., modus ponens, conjunction introduction)</li>
    <li>Allows derivation of outcomes based on material properties and causal dynamics</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Aetherial Inference</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Requires <strong>resolution rules</strong>:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>If a structure is internally coherent, the Form may instantiate.</li>
      <li>If contradiction is detected, the structure collapses.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>

  <p>This system affirms that even formal systems are approximations. But within these constraints, we can still model structural persistence, failure, and obligation with rigor.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>Order of Description</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Meta</strong>: general structural axioms</li>
    <li><strong>Macro</strong>: domain-specific patterns and laws</li>
    <li><strong>Micro</strong>: individuated configurations</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This stratification affirms the <em>however defined</em> principle—precision is always contingent on contextual necessity, not ontological totality.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>Domain Mapping</h2>
  <p>A critical operation is the <strong>mapping</strong> from Objects to Forms:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>From measurable behavior to resolved meaning</li>
    <li>From causal aggregation to semantic identification</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Example: A physical tool becomes a <em>hammer</em> not by mass or shape alone, but by <em>matching the resolved Form</em> of "that which answers to hammer."</p>

  <p>Mapping allows the system to model dual instantiation, and test coherence across domains.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>Resolution and Collapse</h2>
  <p>All modeled structures must either:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Resolve</strong>: instantiate with internal coherence, or</li>
    <li><strong>Collapse</strong>: fail to instantiate due to contradiction</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This applies across systems:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>To concepts</li>
    <li>To selves</li>
    <li>To models</li>
    <li>To ethical actions</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Collapse is not failure to predict—it is failure to <em>cohere</em>.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>Fidelity Metrics</h2>
  <p>A structural logic system allows formal evaluation of:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Fidelity to Form</strong>: how well a structure preserves coherence</li>
    <li><strong>F/S Ratio</strong>: fidelity relative to structural complexity</li>
  </ul>

  <p>These metrics allow diagnostic and comparative evaluation of theories, models, identities, or agents. They also open the door to <strong>coherence testing</strong> in AI, cognition, or ethics.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>Applications</h2>

  <h3>Predictive Modeling</h3>
  <p>Integrate structural resolution into scientific models to assess both physical accuracy <em>and</em> semantic intelligibility.</p>

  <h3>Philosophy of Mind</h3>
  <p>Model experience as recursive resolution across time. Consciousness becomes measurable not by output, but by depth of coherence.</p>

  <h3>Ethics</h3>
  <p>Wrong actions are not simply disliked—they contradict resolved Forms. Moral collapse is a formal outcome of incoherence, not a social judgment.</p>

  <h3>Identity and Systems</h3>
  <p>Identity is preserved coherence across time. Collapse of self or system is modeled as recursive structural failure.</p>

  <h3>Artificial Intelligence</h3>
  <p>Assess AI not by task success, but by its capacity to instantiate coherent Forms. Structural coherence becomes a test for synthetic agency.</p>

  <h3>Mathematics and Logic</h3>
  <p>Math is not invented—it is resolution without empirical instantiation. The formal system affirms mathematical truth as a subclass of Aetherial presence.</p>

  <h2>Structural Implications</h2>
  <p><strong>This is not a metaphor.</strong></p>
  <p>Formalizing the New Ontology brings us closer to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A universal logic of force and meaning</li>
    <li>A computational language for coherence</li>
    <li>A model for obligations, systems, and selves grounded in structure—not sentiment</li>
  </ul>

  <p>It admits incompleteness, but rejects contradiction.  
  It affirms that reality is testable—not by experiment alone, but by whether it <em>resolves</em>.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>Final Statement</h2>
  <p>The formal logic of the New Ontology is not merely a scaffold—it is a recognition:</p>

  <blockquote>That whatever persists, persists <em>through structure</em>.  
  And whatever collapses, collapses <em>because it contradicts</em>.</blockquote>

  <p>This logic is not optional.  
  It is the grammar of what is.</p>
