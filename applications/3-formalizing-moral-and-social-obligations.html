  <h1>Formalizing Moral and Social Obligations</h1>
  <em>Grounding ethics and society in structural coherence</em>

  <hr>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>The New Ontology defines reality as the resolution of structure across two interdependent domains:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The Empirical Domain, governed by force</li>
    <li>The Aetherial Domain, governed by meaning</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Moral and social obligations are not imposed from outside.  
  They are the structural consequences of coherence and collapse.</p>

  <p>This supplement invites interdisciplinary collaboration to formalize moral and social obligation within this dual-domain architecture, and to develop objective criteria for evaluating ethical actions, institutional integrity, and social coherence.</p>

  <h2>Reinterpreting Obligation in Structural Terms</h2>

  <h3>Structural Foundations of Obligation</h3>
  <p>Moral obligation arises when meaning-bearing Forms resolve coherently in the presence of agency.</p>

  <p>Actions that violate coherence are not merely imprudent.  
  <strong>They are structurally wrong.</strong></p>

  <p>Ethics is not sentiment.  
  It is fidelity to Form under constraint.</p>

  <blockquote>Wrongness is not failure.  
  It is contradiction made manifest through action.</blockquote>

  <p>The F/S Ratio provides an evaluative metric:  
  How much structural weight is borne by how much actual fidelity?</p>

  <p>This metric grounds moral judgment in resolution—not emotion, tradition, or result.</p>

  <h3>Social Obligation as Systemic Coherence</h3>
  <p>Societies are systems—recursive structures seeking coherence over time.  
  Their obligations are not invented.  
  They emerge when shared norms sustain both presence and meaning.</p>

  <p>Institutional behavior must cohere not only within the Empirical Domain (policy, action) but with the Aetherial (meaning, justice, trust).</p>

  <p>Social obligation is the mapping of material behavior to ethical Form.  
  Where that mapping fails, systems collapse—not always visibly, but structurally.</p>

  <h2>Toward Formalization: A Dual-Domain Framework</h2>

  <h3>A. Ethical Language and Domain-Specific Predicates</h3>
  <p>Define Aetherial predicates:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>Coheres(x)</code></li>
    <li><code>Violates(x, F)</code></li>
    <li><code>Obligated(x)</code></li>
    <li><code>Fidelity(x, F)</code></li>
  </ul>

  <p>Complement these with empirical observables:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Institutional stability</li>
    <li>Social trust</li>
    <li>Cooperation indices</li>
    <li>Conflict emergence</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Only when both domains instantiate coherently can we say an obligation has been fulfilled.</p>

  <h3>B. Resolution and Collapse in Ethical Inference</h3>
  <p><strong>Moral Resolution Rule:</strong>  
  If an action aligns with a resolved Form and its material expression does not contradict that Form, it is permissible.</p>

  <p><strong>Collapse Rule:</strong>  
  If an action contradicts the Form it purports to instantiate—or generates structural incoherence—it fails, regardless of perceived success.</p>

  <p>These rules formalize morality not as reaction, but as resolution.</p>

  <h3>C. Metrics and Assessment Tools</h3>
  <p><strong>F/S Ratio for Ethics:</strong>  
  Evaluate moral action by its fidelity to the structural weight it bears.</p>

  <p><strong>Simulation and Modeling:</strong>  
  Model institutions as coherence-bearing systems.  
  Test how policies, laws, and norms preserve or violate structural integrity.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>Research and Collaboration</h2>

  <h3>A. Interdisciplinary Workshops</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>What measurable behaviors correlate with resolved moral Forms?</li>
    <li>How do we formally detect collapse in social systems?</li>
    <li>What principles govern structural integrity across time and scale?</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>B. Pilot Studies and Modeling</h3>
  <p><strong>Computational Ethics:</strong>  
  Simulate agent interactions under structural constraints.  
  Observe which patterns generate long-term coherence.</p>

  <p><strong>Organizational Case Studies:</strong>  
  Test real-world policies for alignment with stated values.  
  Measure whether structures resolve or contradict under pressure.</p>

  <h3>C. Publications and Grants</h3>
  <p>Develop interdisciplinary papers that model ethics as structural presence.  
  Apply for joint funding to support simulation, measurement, and theoretical refinement.</p>

  <h2>Broader Implications</h2>

  <h3>A. Beyond Cultural Relativism</h3>
  <p>Moral truth is not preference.  
  It is resolution that holds under recursive pressure.</p>

  <p>Different cultures may express Forms differently,  
  But coherence is not relative.</p>

  <h3>B. Bridging Normative and Empirical</h3>
  <p>Ethics becomes testable—not because it becomes shallow,  
  But because structure admits no contradiction.</p>

  <p>This allows policy, law, and interpersonal behavior  
  To be modeled not only by outcome—but by fidelity.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>To act with moral fidelity is to act in a way that coheres.</p>

  <p>This supplement offers a path to model that fidelity.  
  Not with commandments, but with structure.  
  Not with sentiment, but with resolution.</p>

  <p>We call on ethicists, systems theorists, cognitive scientists, and modelers:  
  Help us build the logic of obligation,  
  The metrics of trust,  
  And the systems that do not collapse.</p>

  <blockquote>Because coherence is not advice.  
  It is what must hold,  
  If anything is to remain.</blockquote>
