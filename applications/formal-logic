# Formal Logic of the New Ontology  
*A dual-sorted logic model for capturing force, meaning, and resolution in the Master Domain.*

---

## Introduction

The New Ontology asserts that reality is a dual-domain structure in which all intelligible phenomena instantiate through force in the Empirical Domain and through coherence in the Aetherial Domain.

This document outlines a **minimum viable product** for a formal logic system capable of modeling structural presence, identity, and collapse — enabling conceptual and computational modeling of the ontology.

## Dual-Sorted Syntax

- **Empirical Terms**: Objects, governed by force — e.g., mass, motion, configuration  
- **Aetherial Terms**: Forms, governed by coherence — e.g., meaning, contradiction, alignment

Each domain maintains its own syntactic rules. Together, they model presence and intelligibility.

---

## Interpretation Functions

- **Empirical Interpretation**: Maps objects to measurable, causal structure  
- **Aetherial Interpretation**: Maps Forms to coherence-based constraints and meanings

Mapping across domains allows us to evaluate structural validity and moral alignment.

---

## Inference and Proof

- **Empirical Inference**: Classical deduction (e.g., modus ponens, conjunction)  
- **Aetherial Inference**: Requires resolution — coherence permits instantiation, contradiction forces collapse

Even formalism must acknowledge its own structural limits.

---

## Order of Description

1. **Meta**: General axioms  
2. **Macro**: Domain-specific laws  
3. **Micro**: Individual configurations

Supports the *however defined* principle — precision arises from structural necessity, not presumption.

---

## Domain Mapping

Example: A tool becomes a *hammer* not by shape or mass, but by **matching the resolved Form** of "that which answers to hammer."  

This allows dual instantiation and cross-domain evaluation.

---

## Resolution and Collapse

All structures must:  
- **Resolve**: instantiate with internal coherence  
- **Collapse**: fail due to contradiction

This logic applies to theories, actions, selves, systems.

---

## Fidelity Metrics

- **Fidelity to Form**: How well coherence is preserved  
- **F/S Ratio**: Fidelity relative to structural complexity

Enables diagnostic comparison across agents, models, and actions.

---

## Applications

- **Predictive Modeling**: Assess both empirical validity and semantic structure  
- **Philosophy of Mind**: Consciousness as recursive coherence  
- **Ethics**: Wrong action = contradiction of resolved Form  
- **Identity**: Preserved coherence across time  
- **AI**: Agenthood = capacity to instantiate coherent Forms  
- **Math**: Aetherial resolution without empirical instantiation

---

## Structural Implications

This is not a metaphor.

> Reality becomes testable — not by outcome alone, but by whether it resolves.

Structure defines persistence. Contradiction ensures collapse.

---

## Final Statement

The formal logic of the New Ontology is not scaffolding — it is recognition.

> That whatever persists, persists through structure.  
> That whatever collapses, collapses because it contradicts.

This is not optional.  
This is the grammar of what is.
