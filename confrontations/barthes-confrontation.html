    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Confrontation: Roland Barthes</h1>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><em>Semiotics vs. the Ontology of Meaning</em></p>

    <h2>I. Thinker</h2>
    <p>Roland Barthes – Known for his work in literary theory and semiotics, especially the essay “The Death of the Author”. Positioned as a post-structuralist who dismantled authorial intention in favor of reader interpretation.</p>

    <h2>II. Central Philosophical Claim Challenged</h2>
    <p>Barthes argued that meaning is not anchored in authorial intent but arises solely from the interplay of language and the reader’s interpretation. The author becomes irrelevant. Interpretation is infinite. Meaning is always deferred, contextual, unstable.</p>

    <h2>III. Claimed Consequences</h2>
    <p>If authorial intent is void, then all interpretations are equally valid. There is no privileged stance from which to assess meaning. The structure of communication collapses into a sea of shifting codes.</p>

    <h2>IV. Structural Conflict</h2>
    <p>The New Ontology affirms the asymptotic nature of interpretation—but denies that this entails infinite validity. Meaning must resist contradiction to exist at all. Misinterpretation proves the presence of structure—what was intended, what was received, and what fails to align. If all readings were valid, misreading wouldn’t exist.</p>

    <h2>V. Reconciliation Attempt</h2>
    <p>Barthes’ insights are preserved as a lens for literary reception—but bounded to their domain. The author’s intention is not omnipotent, but nor is it irrelevant. Meaning is a co-instantiation between speaker and listener, structured by coherence and constrained by possible Forms. His critique dissolves absolutes but cannot dissolve structure itself.</p>

    <h2>VI. Verdict</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Interpretation is asymptotic—but not chaotic.</li>
      <li>Some readings are structurally incoherent—therefore not all are valid.</li>
      <li>Authorial intent is not supreme—but it is a real vector of meaning.</li>
      <li>The structure of communication depends on Forms—without which meaning disintegrates.</li>
      <li>Barthes was right about literature. He was wrong about reality.</li>
    </ul>
