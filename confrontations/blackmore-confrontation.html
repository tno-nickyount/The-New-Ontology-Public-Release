    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Confrontation: Susan Blackmore</h1>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><em>Illusionism vs. Structural Experience</em></p>

    <h2>I. Thinker</h2>
    <p>Susan Blackmore – Known for defending illusionism in the philosophy of mind: the view that consciousness, selfhood, and subjective experience are convincing illusions with no underlying reality.</p>

    <h2>II. Central Philosophical Claim Challenged</h2>
    <p>Blackmore argues that subjective experience is not a real phenomenon but an emergent illusion created by brain processes. What feels like consciousness is merely the brain’s recursive model of itself—useful for evolutionary purposes, but ontologically empty.</p>

    <h2>III. Claimed Consequences</h2>
    <p>If consciousness is an illusion, there is no need to explain it as ontologically real. Questions of meaning, selfhood, or first-person experience can be reduced to pattern recognition and functional outputs.</p>

    <h2>IV. Structural Conflict</h2>
    <p>This view commits a category error by treating the illusion of experience as separable from experience itself. The act of claiming experience is illusory requires experience to make the claim. One cannot coherently deny the ontological reality of structure-present-to-itself without presupposing it in the act of denial. Illusionism collapses into structural incoherence: it asserts a Form (experience) while denying its existence—a contradiction under the Aetherial grammar.</p>

    <h2>V. Reconciliation Attempt</h2>
    <p>One might propose that Blackmore is not denying experience per se, but reclassifying it as functionally derivative and epistemically unreliable. But under the New Ontology, experience is not epistemic—it is ontological presence. Whether or not experience is “reliable” has no bearing on whether it is. A simulated coherence is still a coherent structure. Therefore, even an illusion is a real Aetherial Form—and must be treated as such.</p>

    <h2>VI. Verdict</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Blackmore’s claim violates the Principle of Self-Exclusion: it denies a reality while requiring it.</li>
      <li>Illusion is not ontological negation—it is misalignment between Form and resolution.</li>
      <li>Experience is not granted by accuracy—it is granted by presence.</li>
      <li>Illusionism fails not by accident, but by structural necessity.</li>
    </ul>
