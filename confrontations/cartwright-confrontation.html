    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Confrontation: Nancy Cartwright</h1>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><em>Anti-Universalism vs. Structural Necessity</em></p>

    <h2>I. Thinker</h2>
    <p>Nancy Cartwright is a philosopher of science known for challenging idealized scientific laws and promoting a contextual, causal account of reality. She is a leading advocate for scientific realism grounded in the messiness of actual practice rather than abstract formalism.</p>

    <h2>II. Central Philosophical Claim Challenged</h2>
    <p>Cartwright argues that scientific laws “lie”—that is, they are not literal truths about the world, but rather idealized models that work only under tightly constrained conditions. As such, “truth” in science must be interpreted through causal capacities and local models, not universal regularities.</p>

    <h2>III. Claimed Consequences</h2>
    <p>This leads Cartwright to reject the idea of unified, domain-independent laws, asserting that truth is localized and fragmented, grounded in the empirical regularities of practice rather than metaphysical structure.</p>

    <h2>IV. Structural Conflict</h2>
    <p>The New Ontology affirms that empirical lawfulness is structurally real, not because the laws are perfect, but because structure itself is the constraint on what may happen. Cartwright’s claim collapses structure into utility, denying that there are cross-contextual constraints that endure even when local models fail. This confuses approximation (our models) with ontology (the real structures to which they orient). The New Ontology, by contrast, acknowledges that definitions are approximations, but affirms that coherence is not.</p>

    <h2>V. Reconciliation Attempt</h2>
    <p>Cartwright is right to critique naive realism that treats scientific models as literal mirrors. The New Ontology agrees: all definitions are asymptotic. But this does not entail that structure is local or truth is fragmented. Structural forces (like gravity) are not invalidated by their idealization; they are real constraints that endure even in partial instantiation. Cartwright’s strength lies in recognizing messiness—her error is mistaking messiness for metaphysical arbitrariness.</p>

    <h2>VI. Verdict</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Cartwright's realism is too weak—it affirms causality but denies structural necessity.</li>
      <li>She fails to distinguish methodological humility from ontological incoherence.</li>
      <li>Her framework cannot account for cross-contextual consistency—because it refuses to posit domain-level structure.</li>
      <li>The New Ontology subsumes her critique as a valid epistemic caution, but rejects her metaphysical retreat.</li>
    </ul>
