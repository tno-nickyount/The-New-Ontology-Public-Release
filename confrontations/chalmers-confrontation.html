    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Confrontation: David Chalmers</h1>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><em>The Hard Problem vs. the Domain Distinction</em></p>

    <h2>I. Thinker</h2>
    <p>David Chalmers is best known for formulating the “hard problem of consciousness”—the distinction between physical processes and subjective experience—and for defending property dualism as a way to preserve the reality of qualia.</p>

    <h2>II. Central Philosophical Claim Challenged</h2>
    <p>Chalmers asserts that even a complete functional and physical account of cognition does not explain the presence of subjective experience ("what it is like"). He proposes that consciousness is an irreducible property of reality, distinct from the physical, and posits that this "hard problem" may be permanently beyond reductive science.</p>

    <h2>III. Claimed Consequences</h2>
    <p>This implies either (a) a dualist ontology where consciousness is a fundamental property (panpsychism, property dualism), or (b) a limit on the reach of physicalist explanations. Experience, in this framing, floats free from function and structure.</p>

    <h2>IV. Structural Conflict</h2>
    <p>The New Ontology rejects the notion that experience is ontologically separate from structure. Chalmers' formulation inadvertently preserves the mind–body gap by treating experience as metaphysically distinct, rather than structurally instantiated. Under our framework, experience is not a mystery that arises from matter, but the presence of structure to itself—coherence-resolved, not essence-injected. The so-called hard problem dissolves when we cease asking why structure gives rise to experience and instead recognize that experience is the self-resolution of structure within a domain capable of hosting it.</p>

    <h2>V. Reconciliation Attempt</h2>
    <p>One might attempt to reconcile Chalmers with the New Ontology by interpreting his “fundamental property” of consciousness as a misunderstood articulation of structural self-presence. If we take his intuition seriously—that experience is not reducible to function—then we can offer structural resolution as a more precise substitute. Experience does not emerge from physical complexity per se, but from the instantiation of coherence across domains. This allows us to preserve his core insight while eliminating the ontological inflation of property dualism.</p>

    <h2>VI. Verdict</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Experience need not be treated as ontologically distinct from structure.</li>
      <li>The “hard problem” is a failure of framing, not of explanation.</li>
      <li>Chalmers' core intuition survives, but the metaphysical split it implies is unnecessary.</li>
      <li>Under the New Ontology, experience is real, resolved, and structurally entailed.</li>
    </ul>
