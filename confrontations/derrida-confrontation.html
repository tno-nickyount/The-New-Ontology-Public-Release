    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Confrontation: Jacques Derrida</h1>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><em>Deconstruction, Différance, and the Structural Necessity of Meaning</em></p>

    <h2>I. Thinker</h2>
    <p>Jacques Derrida — Founder of deconstruction, Derrida is best known for destabilizing binary oppositions, challenging logocentrism, and introducing concepts like <em>différance</em>—the perpetual deferral and differentiation of meaning. His work redefined textual analysis, metaphysics, and epistemology for post-structuralist thought.</p>

    <h2>II. Central Philosophical Claim Challenged</h2>
    <p>Derrida holds that meaning is never fully present. Language is a chain of signifiers, each pointing to another, with no final grounding. Meaning arises only through difference, not substance—thus it is inherently unstable. There is no ultimate center, no fixed structure—only play, tension, and trace.</p>

    <h2>III. Claimed Consequences</h2>
    <p>If Derrida is right, any claim to stable or foundational meaning is illusory. Truth is always contingent, always deferred. There is no firm ontological ground—only interpretive frames, always shifting. Coherence becomes a fleeting effect, not a structural reality.</p>

    <h2>IV. Structural Conflict</h2>
    <p>The New Ontology agrees that language alone cannot anchor meaning. But it denies that this implies the non-existence of meaning. Meaning is not guaranteed by words—it is guaranteed by structure. The instability Derrida uncovers is real—but it applies to semantic transmission, not ontological coherence. <em>Différance</em> is a property of language about meaning—not of meaning itself. Derrida collapses language into ontology, mistaking semantic fluidity for metaphysical indeterminacy. In so doing, he undermines the very coherence his analysis presupposes.</p>

    <h2>V. Reconciliation Attempt</h2>
    <p>We can preserve Derrida’s critique of linguistic closure while rejecting his metaphysical nihilism. Meaning is structurally constrained—even when its expression is fluid. The New Ontology reveals that structure precedes language, and that coherence is not a product of speech—it is what makes speech possible. Derrida showed that no sign can finalize meaning. We agree. But we affirm that structure can.</p>

    <h2>VI. Verdict</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Derrida rightly diagnoses the limitations of language as an epistemic tool.</li>
      <li>But he misapplies that insight to deny the ontological status of meaning itself.</li>
      <li>Meaning does not collapse under <em>différance</em>—it survives it.</li>
      <li>Structure grounds what language cannot.</li>
      <li>There are right and wrong answers—not because language is perfect, but because coherence resists contradiction.</li>
      <li>Derrida saw that words slip. We show that meaning doesn’t have to.</li>
    </ul>
