    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Confrontation: Nelson Goodman</h1>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><em>Worldmaking vs. Structural Reality</em></p>

    <h2>I. Thinker</h2>
    <p>Nelson Goodman was an American philosopher of language, logic, and aesthetics. In <em>Ways of Worldmaking</em>, he argued that humans do not discover a pre-existing world but construct many “worlds” through symbol systems—especially via science, art, and classification. He blurred the line between representation and reality, insisting that no symbolic system holds privileged status as the true depiction of the world.</p>

    <h2>II. Central Philosophical Claim Challenged</h2>
    <p>Goodman contends that there is no single, pre-given world waiting to be accurately represented. Instead, we “make” worlds by the symbol systems we use to interpret and organize experience. These worlds are not fictional or illusory—but structurally real in their own terms, each with its own rules of coherence.</p>

    <h2>III. Claimed Consequences</h2>
    <p>If Goodman is right, then no ontological primacy can be given to a single version of reality. Scientific models, religious metaphors, and artistic visions are all forms of worldmaking, with no transcendent hierarchy among them. Truth becomes contextual, not absolute.</p>

    <h2>IV. Structural Conflict</h2>
    <p>The New Ontology agrees that representations mediate access to reality—but not that they construct it. A domain’s structural rules exist independently of how we model or describe them. Goodman confuses access with authorship. Just as the laws of physics govern behavior regardless of theoretical framework, Aetherial Forms exist independently of cultural representation. Worldmaking is a mode of orientation, not a creative act ex nihilo. Structure is not summoned by symbol—it is revealed or distorted by it.</p>

    <h2>V. Reconciliation Attempt</h2>
    <p>We can retain Goodman’s insight that symbolic mediation affects perception, without conceding that it determines reality. Different representational schemes may reveal different aspects of a structurally unified world—but they do not create ontologically distinct realities. Worldmaking is the act of approximation—not creation. Under the New Ontology, symbols do not make the world; they seek to resolve into it.</p>

    <h2>VI. Verdict</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Right that access to reality is mediated by symbols.</li>
      <li>Right that different models yield different structural views.</li>
      <li>Wrong to suggest that structure itself is constructed by symbol.</li>
      <li>Wrong to erase ontological priority in favor of epistemic pluralism.</li>
      <li>Corrective: There is one structured reality, revealed imperfectly through many approximations—but not built by them.</li>
    </ul>
