    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Confrontation: Sam Harris</h1>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><em>The Moral Landscape vs. Ontological Structure</em></p>

    <h2>I. Thinker</h2>
    <p>Sam Harris — A neuroscientist and philosopher, Harris is known for his work on morality, religion, and the intersection of science and human values. His book <em>The Moral Landscape</em> proposes that science can objectively determine moral values based on the well-being of conscious beings.</p>

    <h2>II. Central Philosophical Claim Challenged</h2>
    <p>Harris contends that moral truths exist and that science can identify them by understanding facts about human and animal well-being. He suggests that questions of good and evil, right and wrong, are fundamentally questions about the experiences of conscious creatures and that these can be objectively studied.</p>

    <h2>III. Claimed Consequences</h2>
    <p>If science can determine moral values, then traditional philosophical and religious approaches to ethics become obsolete. Moral relativism is undermined, as objective measures of well-being provide clear answers to moral questions. This positions science as the ultimate authority on morality.</p>

    <h2>IV. Structural Conflict</h2>
    <p>While the New Ontology agrees that well-being is a crucial aspect of morality, it asserts that science operates within an ontological framework that it cannot, by itself, establish. Science can inform us about the consequences of actions on well-being, but the grounding of moral imperatives requires an understanding of the underlying structure of reality. Without acknowledging this structure, science lacks the normative force to dictate moral values.</p>

    <h2>V. Reconciliation Attempt</h2>
    <p>A synthesis can be achieved by recognizing that science contributes valuable empirical data about well-being, which can inform our moral decisions. However, this empirical approach must be integrated within a broader ontological understanding that provides the foundation for why well-being matters morally. By combining scientific insights with ontological grounding, a more comprehensive and coherent moral framework emerges.</p>

    <h2>VI. Verdict</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>What is preserved:</strong> The emphasis on well-being as central to moral considerations and the use of empirical data to inform ethical decisions.</li>
      <li><strong>What is rejected:</strong> The notion that science alone can fully determine moral values without an underlying ontological basis.</li>
      <li><strong>What is clarified:</strong> Science is a tool that operates within an ontological context; it informs but does not independently ground morality.</li>
      <li><strong>What is added:</strong> An acknowledgment of the necessity of ontological foundations to provide normative force to moral claims.</li>
      <li>Science illuminates the paths to well-being, but it is the underlying structure of reality that gives morality its grounding. Without acknowledging this structure, moral science floats unanchored.</li>
    </ul>
