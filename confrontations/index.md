# Confrontations Archive

This section houses the **direct engagements** between The New Ontology and rival ontological, metaphysical, and epistemic frameworks.  
Each confrontation is designed to pressure-test the structure of the ontology ‚Äî not rhetorically, but structurally.

These are not strawmen.  
Each system is treated as a worthy contender.  
Our standard is not dominance, but coherence under contradiction.
