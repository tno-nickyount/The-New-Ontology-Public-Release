# Confrontations Archive

This section houses the **direct engagements** between The New Ontology and rival ontological, metaphysical, and epistemic frameworks.  
Each confrontation is designed to pressure-test the structure of the ontology ‚Äî not rhetorically, but structurally.

These are not strawmen.  
Each system is treated as a worthy contender.  
Our standard is not dominance, but coherence under contradiction.

## Philosophical Confrontations

Planned and in-progress entries include:

- **Ontic Structural Realism** (Ladyman, French)  
- **Process Philosophy** (Whitehead, Stengers)  
- **Classical and Neo-Platonism** (Plato, Plotinus)  
- **Contemporary Modal Metaphysics** (Lewis, Kripke, Fine)  
- **Absolute Idealism and Neo-Hegelianism** (Hegel, Bradley)  
- **Heideggerian Ontology**  
- **Logical Positivism and Language Games**  
- **Postmodern Anti-Structure**

Each confrontation will follow a consistent format:
- Summary of the rival framework  
- Statement of tension or conflict  
- Structured comparison  
- Resolution attempt (if possible)  
- Resulting refinement (if warranted)
