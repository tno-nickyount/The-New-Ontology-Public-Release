    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Confrontation: Frank Jackson</h1>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><em>The Knowledge Argument vs. Structural Dual-Domain Ontology</em></p>

    <h2>I. Thinker</h2>
    <p>Frank Jackson — A philosopher of mind and language, Jackson gained prominence through his critique of physicalism using intuition-based thought experiments. “Mary’s Room” became a central pivot point in debates over qualia, experience, and the nature of consciousness. Though Jackson eventually adopted a physicalist stance, his argument remains widely cited in support of non-reductive views of mind.</p>

    <h2>II. Central Philosophical Claim Challenged</h2>
    <p>Even if a person has complete physical knowledge about a phenomenon, they can still lack access to the experiential aspect of it. This implies that experience contains information that is not physical—therefore, physicalism is incomplete.</p>

    <h2>III. Claimed Consequences</h2>
    <p>If physical facts do not account for all the facts, then some truths—especially those involving subjective experience—must lie outside the scope of empirical science. This lends support to dualism or at least to epistemic gaps in physicalist ontologies.</p>

    <h2>IV. Structural Conflict</h2>
    <p>The New Ontology affirms Jackson’s core insight—that knowing all the physical facts is insufficient to capture experience—but reinterprets it within a dual-domain framework. Mary lacks Aetherial access to the Form of red prior to encountering it; her physical knowledge corresponds only to empirical structures. Experience, as the presence of structure to itself, is governed by meaning in the Aetherial Domain—not by empirical force alone. The “new knowledge” Mary gains is not a new empirical fact, but the instantiation of coherence between her own Aetherial structure and the Form of red. Jackson frames this as an epistemological puzzle; the New Ontology treats it as a structural necessity.</p>

    <h2>V. Reconciliation Attempt</h2>
    <p>Jackson correctly identifies that something is missing in purely physicalist explanations of mind—but his conclusion stops at epistemic dualism. The New Ontology goes further: it posits a structurally real Aetherial Domain in which Forms (like the experience of red) reside and into which meaning coheres. Mary’s transformation upon seeing red is not mystical—it is the alignment of her structural presence with a previously uninstantiated Form. The “knowledge” she gains is ontological participation, not descriptive acquisition.</p>

    <h2>VI. Verdict</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Right:</strong> Physicalism cannot explain experience without remainder.</li>
      <li><strong>Right:</strong> There are truths that only experiential instantiation can access.</li>
      <li><strong>Wrong:</strong> The implication is not dualism per se, but structural parallelism.</li>
      <li><strong>Corrective:</strong> The New Ontology reframes Mary’s case as cross-domain structural resolution—an act of coherence, not mystery.</li>
    </ul>
