    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Confrontation: William James</h1>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><em>Pragmatism and Pluralism vs. Structural Truth</em></p>

    <h2>I. Thinker</h2>
    <p>William James — Known for radical empiricism, pragmatism, and pluralism. He argued that relations are as experientially real as discrete entities, that truth is what works in practice, and that multiple, incompatible truths can coexist meaningfully.</p>

    <h2>II. Central Philosophical Claim Challenged</h2>
    <p>James claims that truth is not an abstract correspondence with some absolute structure, but rather the set of ideas that prove themselves useful to believe. He insists that experience is the ground of reality, and that coherence arises not from structural necessity, but from practical success in navigating lived phenomena.</p>

    <h2>III. Claimed Consequences</h2>
    <p>If James is right, there may be no need for a singular ontology—just multiple working models that need not agree so long as they function. "Truth" becomes inseparable from contextual usefulness, collapsing the difference between coherence and convenience.</p>

    <h2>IV. Structural Conflict</h2>
    <p>The New Ontology affirms James’ intuition that experience is real and relational—but rejects the idea that truth just is what works. Pragmatism may serve as a heuristic, but cannot be elevated into a first principle. A model may work without being structurally accurate—just as a myth can guide behavior without mapping to ontological reality. Pluralism is also overstated: different experiences may reflect different resolutions of a shared structure, but they cannot contradict each other without violating coherence. Truth may be perceived through lenses, but it is not created by them.</p>

    <h2>V. Reconciliation Attempt</h2>
    <p>One could argue that James is not denying structural reality, but acknowledging our limited access to it. In this light, pragmatism is not a metaphysical claim but an epistemic posture. But even so, the New Ontology draws a harder line: functionality is not fidelity. Useful beliefs may be partially aligned with truth, but they are not immune to structural critique. Only coherence can validate a claim ontologically, regardless of its instrumental success.</p>

    <h2>VI. Verdict</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>James recognizes the realness of experience, but softens the demands of structural fidelity.</li>
      <li>Pragmatism is useful—but truth cannot be reduced to utility.</li>
      <li>Pluralism acknowledges multiplicity of perspective, but collapses without a shared structural ground.</li>
      <li>The New Ontology affirms experience, but insists on coherence.</li>
      <li>What works may be helpful. But what is must still be reckoned with.</li>
    </ul>
