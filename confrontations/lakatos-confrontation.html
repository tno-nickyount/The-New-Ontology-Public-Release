    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Confrontation: Imre Lakatos</h1>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><em>Research Programs vs. Ontological Constraint</em></p>

    <h2>I. Thinker</h2>
    <p>Imre Lakatos was a philosopher of science known for his refinement of falsificationism into the concept of "research programs." Each program has a "hard core" of central commitments and a "protective belt" of auxiliary hypotheses that can be adjusted in response to empirical anomalies. Scientific progress, in this view, is not a matter of individual theories being falsified, but of programs being progressive (predictive and corroborated) or degenerative (post-hoc and unfalsifiable).</p>

    <h2>II. Central Philosophical Claim Challenged</h2>
    <p>Lakatos asserts that science is best understood not as a series of falsified theories, but as evolving research programs that respond to empirical pressure while preserving core commitments. The validity of a program lies not in any individual theory's truth, but in the fruitfulness and problem-solving capacity of the overall framework over time.</p>

    <h2>III. Claimed Consequences</h2>
    <p>Scientific truth becomes a function of explanatory power and continuity rather than direct correspondence to reality. Competing programs may persist for long periods without resolution. Objectivity is located in the process—not in the structure of reality itself. Ontology is bracketed in favor of theoretical fertility.</p>

    <h2>IV. Structural Conflict</h2>
    <p>The New Ontology accepts that science is historically embedded—but denies that this justifies ontological agnosticism. The reason some programs are progressive is not merely sociological—it is because they are more aligned with the structure of reality. Scientific theories do not merely "work"—they converge asymptotically on truths governed by the structural features of the Empirical Domain. Paradigms are not equal; their fidelity to structural constraints varies.</p>

    <h2>V. Reconciliation Attempt</h2>
    <p>Lakatos can be seen as mapping the behavior of science under real constraints—without naming those constraints. His model describes the path of scientific evolution without claiming a fixed destination. The New Ontology fills in the missing element: the reason science progresses is because reality has a structure, and our approximations can be ranked by how closely they reflect it.</p>

    <h2>VI. Verdict</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Right that falsification is too simplistic—progress is programmatic, not piecemeal.</li>
      <li>Right that theories should be judged over time, not by isolated anomalies.</li>
      <li>Wrong to withhold ontological commitment—structure is real and constraining.</li>
      <li>The New Ontology provides the foundation Lakatos’s model lacked: the structured reality that makes scientific progress possible.</li>
    </ul>
