    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Confrontation: Bruno Latour</h1>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><em>Actor-Network Theory vs. Domain-Specific Structure</em></p>

    <h2>I. Thinker</h2>
    <p>Bruno Latour was a French philosopher and sociologist best known for developing Actor-Network Theory (ANT), which rejects the subject-object dichotomy and emphasizes that scientific facts are not discovered but constructed through complex networks of human and non-human actors. In <em>We Have Never Been Modern</em>, Latour critiques the Enlightenment distinction between nature and society, arguing that we never truly separated the two. His work has been highly influential in science and technology studies (STS), posthumanism, and critical theory.</p>

    <h2>II. Central Philosophical Claim Challenged</h2>
    <p>Latour’s central claim is that reality is constituted through networks of relations, not through any intrinsic or hierarchical properties of the entities involved. Humans, texts, microbes, laboratories, and machines all function as “actors” in the co-construction of knowledge and meaning. There is no privileged ontological status—no grounding reality—outside the web of influence.</p>

    <h2>III. Claimed Consequences</h2>
    <p>If knowledge is constructed through these flat actor-networks, then science is not uncovering objective truths but assembling temporary stabilizations. Meaning and truth become effects of relational entanglement rather than reflections of any independent structure. Authority collapses into distributed negotiation; epistemology becomes politics by other means.</p>

    <h2>IV. Structural Conflict</h2>
    <p>The New Ontology rejects the ontological flattening that Latour proposes. While we affirm that all things participate in structure, we deny that all participants are structurally equivalent. A particle, a person, and a legal institution are not identical kinds of actors. Structural reality divides into distinct domains—Empirical and Aetherial—governed by different logics: force and meaning. Participation in a network is not itself meaning; it may produce meaning, but only if coherence is resolved across domains. By conflating influence with coherence and treating interaction as indistinguishable from structural alignment, Latour undermines the very distinction that makes meaning intelligible. In his network, contradiction cannot be detected—only negotiated.</p>

    <h2>V. Reconciliation Attempt</h2>
    <p>Latour’s actor-network model can be rehabilitated as a descriptive heuristic for tracking how meaning is socially instantiated—but not as an ontology. His insight that institutions, technologies, and discourses co-produce outcomes is valuable as an account of Aetherial emergence—but he misfires in denying that those emergent patterns are ultimately judged against structural coherence. The New Ontology affirms that networks matter, but only structure explains.</p>

    <h2>VI. Verdict</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Right to critique naïve objectivity and the myth of isolated scientific discovery.</li>
      <li>Right to highlight the entanglement of material, social, and symbolic actors.</li>
      <li>Wrong to deny ontological hierarchy among domains of structure.</li>
      <li>Wrong to conflate participation with coherence, and interaction with truth.</li>
      <li><strong>Corrective:</strong> Structural reality distinguishes what is entangled from what is true. Coherence, not negotiation, remains the arbiter of meaning.</li>
    </ul>
