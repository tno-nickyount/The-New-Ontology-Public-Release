    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Confrontation: W.V.O. Quine</h1>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><em>Ontological Relativity vs. Structural Necessity</em></p>

    <h2>I. Thinker</h2>
    <p>Willard Van Orman Quine was a 20th-century analytic philosopher best known for challenging the analytic–synthetic distinction and developing confirmation holism. In works like “Two Dogmas of Empiricism,” he argued that our beliefs form an interconnected web, with no sharp boundary between statements grounded in logic and those based on experience. His stance implies that ontology itself is revisable and theory-laden.</p>

    <h2>II. Central Philosophical Claim Challenged</h2>
    <p>Quine denies the possibility of analytic truths divorced from empirical revision. According to him, our conceptual framework is a seamless whole, with every belief subject to revision based on new observations. As such, there is no fixed ontology—only shifting models justified by pragmatic fit.</p>

    <h2>III. Claimed Consequence</h2>
    <p>If all knowledge is part of a revisable web, then ontological claims are contingent on theory choice. Reality becomes whatever best fits our observations, and metaphysical commitments lose any absolute grounding. Ontology becomes epistemology's servant.</p>

    <h2>IV. Structural Conflict</h2>
    <p>The New Ontology recognizes the importance of empirical revision—but insists that reality consists of domains structured by different principles. The Aetherial Domain, governed by coherence rather than observation, cannot be subsumed into Quine’s web without distortion. Ontological claims grounded in the structure of meaning are not theory-laden—they are structurally entailed. The distinction between empirical success and structural reality must be preserved to avoid collapsing meaning into modeling.</p>

    <h2>V. Reconciliation Attempt</h2>
    <p>Quine’s insight into the interdependence of belief is preserved within the Empirical Domain: models must indeed evolve in response to observation. But the mistake is to treat this epistemic dynamic as metaphysically total. The New Ontology accommodates Quine’s holism as a methodological insight, not an ontological claim. Structure remains independent of how we model it.</p>

    <h2>VI. Verdict</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Right about the entanglement of belief and observation within empirical science.</li>
      <li>Wrong to collapse ontology into epistemology.</li>
      <li>Incorrect to treat structure as contingent on theory.</li>
      <li>The New Ontology restores structural independence across domains—where revision occurs, but truth remains.</li>
    </ul>
