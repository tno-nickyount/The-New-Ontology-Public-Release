    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Confrontation: Wilfrid Sellars</h1>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><em>Myth of the Given vs. Structured Access</em></p>

    <h2>I. Thinker</h2>
    <p>Wilfrid Sellars was a 20th-century American philosopher best known for his rejection of foundational empiricism and his advocacy of a “scientific image” of man in the world. He argued that perception is never epistemically neutral but always shaped by the conceptual systems in which the perceiver is embedded. He is a central figure in analytic philosophy’s turn toward linguistic and conceptual mediation.</p>

    <h2>II. Central Philosophical Claim Challenged</h2>
    <p>Sellars famously rejected the notion of the Given—the idea that raw, uninterpreted sensory experience can serve as a foundation for knowledge. For him, no perception is epistemologically basic; all experiences are interpreted through the lens of prior concepts and linguistic structures. Knowledge, in his view, arises only within a framework of conceptual coherence.</p>

    <h2>III. Claimed Consequence</h2>
    <p>If no experience is epistemically foundational, then justification cannot begin from sensation alone. Instead, justification becomes a matter of how beliefs cohere within a conceptual system. Perception becomes a conceptually saturated event—not a window to the world, but a structured participation in it. The implication is that reality is not accessed through sensation, but through structure.</p>

    <h2>IV. Structural Conflict</h2>
    <p>The New Ontology agrees that no experience is epistemologically primitive—but goes further. We assert that experience itself is structure: not merely interpreted, but instantiated as structural presence. Sellars correctly dismantles the Myth of the Given, but stops short of recognizing that coherence is not just a requirement for knowing—it is the very condition for being. The Aetherial Domain is not a conceptual add-on—it is the domain in which meaning exists, and where experience occurs as the presence of Form to itself. In this way, we move beyond epistemology into ontology proper.</p>

    <h2>V. Reconciliation Attempt</h2>
    <p>Sellars’ critique is a necessary prelude to structural realism. His emphasis on conceptual coherence opens the door to the Aetherial Domain—but he leaves it implied rather than explicit. Where Sellars treats coherence as a requirement for justification, we treat it as the condition for ontological participation. In doing so, we preserve the rigor of his insight while expanding its scope: coherence is not only how we know—it is how we are.</p>

    <h2>VI. Verdict</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Correct:</strong> to reject the notion of unmediated experience.</li>
      <li><strong>Correct:</strong> that perception is conceptually shaped and structurally conditioned.</li>
      <li><strong>Incorrect:</strong> to treat coherence as an epistemic function only.</li>
      <li><strong>Limited:</strong> by not formalizing the ontological domain of meaning (Aetherial).</li>
      <li><strong>Corrective:</strong> Structure is not merely a lens through which experience is filtered—it is the ontological ground of experience itself.</li>
    </ul>
