    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Confrontation: Alfred North Whitehead</h1>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><em>Process Philosophy vs. Structural Continuity</em></p>

    <h2>I. Thinker</h2>
    <p>
      Alfred North Whitehead was a mathematician and philosopher who co-authored <em>Principia Mathematica</em> before turning to metaphysics. In <em>Process and Reality</em>, he proposes that the fundamental constituents of reality are occasions of experience—brief, structured pulses of becoming. These are not passive things, but active processes that include both physical and experiential dimensions. His ontology is marked by holism, creativity, and an emphasis on temporality as a primary metaphysical feature.
    </p>

    <h2>II. Central Philosophical Claim Challenged</h2>
    <p>
      Reality is processual, not substantial. The illusion of stable entities emerges from repeated patterns of events, but the underlying metaphysical truth is that becoming precedes being. All entities are momentary actualizations of experience, and every moment is a novel synthesis of past influences—a creative act of integration.
    </p>

    <h2>III. Claimed Consequences</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>There are no static “objects”—only momentary experiential events.</li>
      <li>Consciousness is not a special property but a universal feature of processual becoming.</li>
      <li>Substance metaphysics is obsolete; only relational processes can adequately describe reality.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>IV. Structural Conflict</h2>
    <p>
      The New Ontology affirms that experience is primary—but not at the expense of structure. Whitehead treats reality as a cascade of events, but downplays the form-structure necessary for identity, coherence, and persistence. An "actual occasion" without structural fidelity cannot instantiate meaning. While he dissolves static substance, he leaves structured coherence underexplained. Experience is not just becoming—it is structured presence within and across domains. The moment does not replace the object; it instantiates it.
    </p>

    <h2>V. Reconciliation Attempt</h2>
    <p>
      Whitehead’s intuition that reality is dynamic and participatory is correct. But process without structure collapses into fluid incoherence. The New Ontology agrees that entities are not frozen substances, but insists that they must resolve into coherent Forms to exist intelligibly. Becoming is not denied—it is qualified. The passage of time does not erase identity if coherence is preserved. A particle endures not by being immutable, but by never violating the structure that defines it. So too with the self.
    </p>

    <h2>VI. Verdict</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Right:</strong> To reject substance metaphysics as insufficient.</li>
      <li><strong>Right:</strong> To prioritize temporality and experiential becoming.</li>
      <li><strong>Wrong:</strong> To treat process as self-sufficient without grounding in structural coherence.</li>
      <li><strong>Wrong:</strong> To flatten all of reality into momentary pulses without accounting for persistence.</li>
      <li><strong>Corrective:</strong> The real is not static substance, but neither is it pure flux. It is structured becoming, where identity is preserved by coherence across time, not continuity of process alone.</li>
    </ul>
