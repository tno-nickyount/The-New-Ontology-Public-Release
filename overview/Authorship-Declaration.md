# 🧾 Authenticity and Authorship Declaration  
**The New Ontology – Public Release – Version 1.1**  

---

This body of work — the *New Ontology Treatise*, *Glossary*, *Supplementary Essays*, *Confrontations Archive*, and *Applications Documents* — together comprise a novel unified ontological framework offered for the benefit of open philosophical discourse, structural clarity, and long-term cultural refinement.

This framework proposes a structural model of reality that resolves the traditional divisions between matter and meaning, fact and value, mind and body, self and system. It defines reality not as substance but as structure, where **coherence is the criterion for existence**, and **contradiction is the signature of collapse**. It offers a rigorously defined account of ethics, identity, obligation, causality, and experience — unified under a non-dual, domain-partitioned ontology.
