# ReadMe — Public Release

Welcome to the public release of **The New Ontology**.  
This archive presents a comprehensive philosophical framework grounded in structural coherence. The materials range from the foundational treatise and glossary to supplementary essays, dialectical confrontations with major paradigms, and interdisciplinary applications across fields such as cognitive science, quantum theory, ethics, evolution, and more.

The goal of this release is twofold:
- To publish the original framework in a time-stamped, immutable form
- To invite rigorous critique, refinement, and engagement from the public intellectual commons
