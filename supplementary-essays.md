# Supplementary Essays

This section contains deeper elaborations on specific concepts introduced in the New Ontology treatise. These essays are not detours—they are structural expansions, grounded in the same logic and rigor that govern the core framework.

Each essay addresses a specific facet of the New Ontology and is self-contained. They may be read in any order, though some assume familiarity with the treatise.
