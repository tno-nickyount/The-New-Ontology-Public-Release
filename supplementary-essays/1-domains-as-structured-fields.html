  <h1>On Domains: Structure and Sufficiency</h1>

  <h2>1. Introduction: What is a Domain?</h2>
  <p>A <em>Domain</em> is a field within which entities are governed by a specific kind of constraint that is irreducible to the constraints of any other Domain. Domains are not categories or subjective groupings; they are <strong>structured fields of action</strong>—loci where contents (Objects, Forms) are shaped by forces or coherence relations. Each Domain enforces a distinct mode of structural necessity, ensuring that what occurs within it adheres to a specific logic.</p>

  <p>In The New Ontology, two Domains are presently recognized:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Empirical Domain:</strong> Contents here are governed by Force—constraints measurable through empirical dynamics (e.g., gravity, thermodynamics, causality).</li>
    <li><strong>Aetherial Domain:</strong> Contents here are governed by Coherence—constraints emerging from non-contradictory structural relations (e.g., mathematics, logic, obligation).</li>
  </ul>

  <p>These Domains operate concurrently but are ontologically distinct. The Empirical governs what happens, the Aetherial governs what holds together meaningfully.</p>

  <h2>2. Why Two Domains? The Conceptual Necessity</h2>
  <p>We observe that every phenomenon can be described in terms of what occurs materially and what coheres structurally. When lifting a hammer:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Its weight and inertia are governed by Force.</li>
    <li>Its identity as a hammer (rather than a lump of matter) is governed by Coherence.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>These two kinds of governance are mutually irreducible:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Force cannot explain meaning.</li>
    <li>Coherence cannot cause motion.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Thus, these Domains reflect the minimum recursion depth required for experience to loop back upon itself: for meaning to arise about what is happening.</p>

  <h2>3. The Principle of Irreducible Constraint Fields</h2>
  <p>A Domain is legitimate if and only if:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>It enforces a constraint that is irreducible—it cannot be fully explained or collapsed into the constraint logic of any other Domain.</li>
    <li>It operates concurrently with existing Domains without contradiction.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This Principle of Irreducible Constraint Fields ensures that Domains are not arbitrarily multiplied. Any proposed Domain must introduce a mode of constraint that is both distinct and concurrent with existing Domains. If its governing logic collapses into Force or Coherence—or requires them to make sense—it is not a third Domain.</p>

  <h2>4. Candidate Analyses: Pure Reasoning Reduction</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Mathematics and Logic:</strong> Governed entirely by Coherence—truth as structural consistency. No causal forces govern mathematical necessity.</li>
    <li><strong>Information Entropy:</strong> Measurable over Empirical state spaces—a count of possible microstates (Force governs the dynamics that allow or restrict these states).</li>
    <li><strong>Aesthetic Forms:</strong> Governed by structural relations (harmony, dissonance)—they are Forms within the Aetherial Domain.</li>
    <li><strong>Social Power Dynamics:</strong> Manifest as Empirical enforcement of Aetherial Forms (laws, norms)—a composite of Force and Coherence.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>All candidates reduce to existing Domains through conceptual collapse, requiring no additional governing logic.</p>

  <h2>5. Falsifiability and Open Constraint</h2>
  <p>At present, two Domains are observable and account for all structured experience:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The <strong>Empirical Domain</strong> (Force-governed).</li>
    <li>The <strong>Aetherial Domain</strong> (Coherence-governed).</li>
  </ul>

  <p>We do not assert conclusively that only two Domains exist. Instead, we assert that two Domains are structurally necessary and sufficient to account for all operative dynamics of reality presently observed and defended within this framework. Any future claim for an additional Domain must satisfy two conditions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>It must present a constraint logic that cannot be reduced to Force or Coherence.</li>
    <li>It must operate concurrently with existing Domains without contradiction.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Until such a Domain is proposed and justified, two Domains remain sufficient.</p>

  <h2>6. Conclusion: Why Domains Matter</h2>
  <p>Domains are not linguistic conveniences—they reflect real loci of constraint that scaffold all experience:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The <strong>Empirical Domain</strong> gives us material causation – physical systems and how they behave.</li>
    <li>The <strong>Aetherial Domain</strong> gives us meaning, logic, and obligation – meaning systems and how they relate.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Together, they make recursive experience possible—the ability to not only encounter the world but to make sense of it.</p>

  <p>The Principle of Irreducible Constraint Fields ensures that this framework is not closed but is resistant to arbitrary expansion. Any claim for a third Domain must withstand structural scrutiny.</p>

  <p>At present, two Domains remain sufficient to account for all structured experience.</p>
